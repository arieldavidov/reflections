When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  it gives you all the cloud benefits

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	because i don't want all my commits going public till  a finished and checked the new feature i am developing 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	clone is copy from remote repo to local
	branch is the history of commits linked to each other
	fork is coping repo from one user to another in the remote site
