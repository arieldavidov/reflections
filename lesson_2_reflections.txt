What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	it creates a new repository and i need it for adding files and they're commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	staging area is the tracked files will commit, working directory is all the files in the directory, and the repository contains a snapshots of the staging areas you have created
