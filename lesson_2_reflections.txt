	it creates a new repository and i need it for adding files and they're commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	staging area is the tracked files will commit, working directory is all the files in the directory, and the repository contains a snapshots of the staging areas you have created

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	i can make a several logical updated which will stay in my working directory and
	add to staging only the files which made the one logical stage and commit it,
	then do it again with the other, etc..
