How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	well i did it with the diff and saw whats changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	i can see the whole process of creating it and can determine what happen in every stage

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	the pros are that you are control over your commits and history
	the cons are that if you forgot to commit in a strategic point and did something wrong

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	every other platforms takes your creation as a single file and with coding use case it's more of reasonable to edit multiple files in one creation which called a package here

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	with git log i see all the commits and there's given description and with diff i see what's have been change

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	i am not afraid to loose myself when a bug suddenly occurs

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	for browsing through files and directories and version control!
